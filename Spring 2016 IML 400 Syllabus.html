<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>IML 400 is a practical course focused on the World Wide Web as a medium. Students will develop technical, design and critical skills for creating modern web applications. Using a hands-on approach, students will explore and analyze key concepts and techniques powering the Web today. The exploration will be motivated by a more nuanced consideration of the webâ€™s function in society gained through readings and discussion. This class assumes familiarity with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, as well as an interest in User Experience and Interaction Design. The practical section of IML 400 will focus on Front End design and development, emphasizing content presentation, interactivity and user experience. Each class will be divided in two sections: lecture/discussion and workshop. Lecture/Discussion time will serve to study the web as a medium from historical, comparative, design, and experimental angles. Introduction of new techniques, and the technical details encountered during the implementation of assignments will be explored during workshop time.</p>
