For our purposes what is more interesting than answering these questions is to look at how folks are examining the "internets" and the inter-relationships of this technology on culture, society, life, (self-) identity, relationships ...

###Participation
From videogames we see an important contribution of  
net art products

Net art is particpatory and engaging. Although at times net art can still be about producing visual artifacts.

## Normalization
In the [Language of New Media](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/language-new-media), Lev Manovich talks about encoding as one of the defining traits of new media.  

New media is encoded as bits, 0's and 1's, and decoded by software to manifest itself. This decoding can also be used to transform media forms

this aesthetic is explored nicely in the [The Glitch Momentum](http://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/no-04-the-glitch-momentum-rosa-menkman/) by Rosa Menkam

## Art as tool/knowledge creation
Glitch requires tool/techinical knowledge as well as critical viewpoints.  

The beauty of technology in contemporary culture is its accessibility. Net artists encorporate education and tool development as artistic practice.
