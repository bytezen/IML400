### What is the point of intellectual property laws?
"Intellectual Property is a general term for the set of intangible assets owned and legally protected by a company from outside user or implementation without consent."
_- Marsh.com _

Companies profit from IP by leveraging its benefits internally (to increase competitive advantage) or externally through licensing and royalty sharing schemes.

The purpose of IP protection is to encourage innovation and economic growth through the stimulation of an ideas economy. The debate/criticism is when it appears to be used to suffocate what it expresses to be protecting.

## Gateway to innovation

"Blame Us...The applications that account for more of the Internetâ€™s traffic include peer-to-peer file transfers, email, company VPNs, the machine-to-machine communications of APIs, Skype calls, World of Warcraft and other online games, Xbox Live, iTunes, voice-over-IP phones, iChat, and Netflix movie streaming. Many of the newer Net applications are closed, often proprietary, networks."

## Not all Bad

API's are not inherently bad. In fact, API's contribute to the 'standards' and 'protocols of access' that contribute to the stability of the web and promote innovation.

## Application Program Interface

A server hosts an application that has a set of functionality. The developers of the application expose a subset of that functionality to users...

## Tons of APIs
There are tons of APIs available for all types of applications:  
* [Open Government](https://www.data.gov/)
* [LA Open Govt](https://data.lacity.org/)
* [The Guardian](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/)
* [The NY Times](http://developer.nytimes.com/)

# Getting Started
]

.right-column[
## Finding APIs
* [Programmable Web](http://programmableweb.com)   
* Search for developers, API on a site of interest  
	* e.g 'etsy developer api'
]

.left-column[
# Getting Started
]

.right-column[
## Getting Started
Most sites have usable and friendly instructions for accessing their APIs.  
There are 3 main types of API access with increasing levels of authentication:

* No Access required  
	Increasingly less common. You specify the URL and the data is returned in a format typically JSON or XML. Read the author's site for details on the data fields.

]

--

.right-column[
* API Keys  
	You register for a, typically free, application ID. When you make requests to the API (i.e. send URLs to the server) you must pass in the API key with the request.  
	Often times the number of requests that you are able to make per some specified time frame are limited. The API key allows the API authors to track the applciations that are making requests.

]

# Getting Started
]

.right-column[

* Authentication
	You obtain a key much like above. In addition you will receive additional authentication details for security. When you make requests either for your application or on behalf of users to your application the additional authentication will be required.  

	_if you end up needing this type of API for your work we can address that separately_

Typically the Authors will provide details about:
 - the types of requests that you can make to the API
 - the format of the data that is returned
 - an example of properly formatted requests

## Google Maps API

[Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)  

We will follow the instructions on the site to get the API setup.  
There is a simple example of using the [Google Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/intro) on Github.
