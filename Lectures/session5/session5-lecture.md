## 1. Objects

Objects are like nouns in grammar:  
	person, place or things.  

They can have properties.  

They can do things.

## 2. Scope

Scope can be very confusing in Javascript! It is completely different than what you are used to in Processing (Java).  

In Javascript scope is controlled by functions.

## 3. Events  
The web is an interactive platform. JS (and jQuery) give us the ability to inspect just about anything the user could do.
