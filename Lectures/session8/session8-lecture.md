## Web as Platform

.right-column[
## Static v. Dynamic
Since the web gained a face (non-textual assets) content creators have worked to shoehorn dynamic content onto the protocol.

[Dynamic Web History](http://royal.pingdom.com/2007/12/07/a-history-of-the-dynamic-web/)

* Early dynamic technology focused on the server.
	* Servers were known and controlled
	* Clients were unknown and non-standard
	* Client machines varied in computer power, resolutions

## The Dynamic Web
]

.right-column[
## Rich Internet Applications (RIA)
* Adobe Flash
* Oracle JavaFX
* Microsoft Silverlight

Bring dynamic content to the web by neutralizing the wild ecosystem of browsers, client machines and HTTP protocol.

Install a plug-in and we guarantee you _(the developer)_ a consistent platform across environments/devices and you _(the user)_ a richer (i.e. more desktop like) experience

## Wacky stuff too...

* [The Internet Arcade](https://archive.org/details/internetarcade)
	- [Javascript Mess](http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Javascript_Mess)
		* Archive.org collection of classic arcade games that can be run on an emulator in the browser

## RIAs

These suffer from some of the same conceptual and technical problems that we discussed in the reading last week. They "break" the web.
* not inherently searchable
* use web for connectivity but are not native web technologies
* closed

## Death of RIAs

* [Thoughts on Flash](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/)  
* [End of Line for Plug-ins](http://www.geekwire.com/2011/adobe-flash-microsoft-silverlight-sunset-browser-plugin/)  
 An interesting read that details internal Adobe decisions (mistakes) that led to the death of flash. An interesting case study for tech entrepreneurs:  
* [The Death of Flash](http://www.visionmobile.com/blog/2011/11/the-death-of-flash-8-years-in-the-making/)  
* [Occupy Flash](http://occupyflash.org)  
* [Occupy HTML](http://occupyhtml.org)    
* [Occupy Technologies](http://www.dailytech.  com/Occupy+Flash+and+Occupy+HTML+Websites+Fight+War+of+Propaganda/article23330.htm)

## Enter HTML5

The continued advancements of HTML5, CSS and Javascript:
* standardization
* functionality

Plus continued advances in PC hardware technology have made Browsers and these technologies the new RIA. The entire web experience is becoming richer independent of 3rd party plugins.

3) [Intro Web Sockets](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/websockets/basics/)  
_"The web has been largely built around the so-called request/response paradigm of HTTP. A client loads up a web page and then nothing happens until the user clicks onto the next page. Around 2005, AJAX started to make the web feel more dynamic. Still, all HTTP communication was steered by the client, which required user interaction or periodic polling to load new data from the server."_

Looks like an interesting Flash-like solution for HTML5 Javascript. Targeted at Banner Ads, but just like Flash lots of possibilities for dynamic motion graphics.
