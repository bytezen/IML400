“User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are some of the most confused and misused terms in our field. A UI without UX is like a painter slapping paint onto canvas without thought; while UX without UI is like the frame of a sculpture with no paper mache on it. A great product experience starts with UX followed by UI. Both are essential for the product’s success.”

_UI_  is the consideration and architecture of how the user interacts with the product. The presentation of the product and how the user can alter its presentation are the chief concerns of UI. UI tactics adhere to the themes of UX design strategy.
