## Magic Trick
]

.right-column[
## version 1
A first pass working implementation of the trick is in the class repo.  
Remember our suggested workflow for development:
  1. get it working
  2. make it fast (enough)
  3. make it elegant for code  

Throughout the semester we will be refactoring this code and using it as a base to explore concepts.
