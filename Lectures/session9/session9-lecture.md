Immersive experiences are not confined to _visual_ immersion.  

Immersion is engagment beyond a stimulus or stimuli sets (e.g. audio visual).  

Immersions engages the psyche as much, or more than, the physical.

## Project
Choose an online social media or entertainment service  
_(facebook, twitter, youtube, netflix, etc),_  
and develop a concept for a virtual reality experience using its content and data.  
Use writing, sketches, mockups and/or visual references from science fiction to illustrate your ideas.  
(Think about using [VR Mockups](http://mozvr.com/posts/quick-vr-prototypes/))
