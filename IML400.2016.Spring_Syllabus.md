Course Description
------
IML 400 is a practical course focused on the World Wide Web as a medium. Students will develop technical, design and critical skills for creating modern web applications. Using a hands-on approach, students will explore and analyze key concepts and techniques powering the Web today. The exploration will be motivated by a more nuanced consideration of the web's function in society gained through readings and discussion. This class assumes familiarity with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, as well as an interest in User Experience and Interaction Design. The practical section of IML 400 will focus on Front End design and development, emphasizing content presentation, interactivity and user experience. Each class will be divided in two sections: lecture/discussion and workshop. Lecture/Discussion time will serve to study the web as a medium from historical, comparative, design, and experimental angles. Introduction of new techniques, and the technical details encountered during the implementation of assignments will be explored during workshop time.

----------
### Grading

- 15% Attendance, Discussion
- 15% Workshop Participation and Performance  
- 30% Assignments (including reading reports) 
- 40% Final Project 

### Assignments
Assignment delivery is every Monday morning unless a different deadline is specified. The inability to meet deadlines will have a negative impact on grades. For team assignments each member of the team should have a page with the assignment in their storm accounts.

### Workshop
Students should upload the result of each workshop session to their storm accounts every time.

### Readings
Readings will be required sometimes. Students are expected to create a webpage with a brief essay about each reading in their storm accounts. 

### Reference Material
Pointers to books and online links will be provided in the class website.


### Uploading Work
Students are expected to follow this organization schema for their online projects:

* IML 400 home directory:  
	* http://storm.usc.edu/~username/IML-400/

* Index file (Cover page):
	* http://storm.usc.edu/~username/IML-400/index.html 
	 _This file should feature a list of links to all work produced by the student_

* Image directory 
	* http://storm.usc.edu/~username/IML-400/img/
	_All images used by webpages located in the class root directory should be located there._
	
* Stylesheet directory
	* http://storm.usc.edu/~username/IML-400/css/
	_All CSS files should be located there_

* Javascript directory
	* http://storm.usc.edu/~username/IML-400/js/
	_All Javascript files should be located there._

* Assignment websites and subdirectories
	* http://storm.usc.edu/~username/IML-400/assignment-x/
	_Each assignment should have it’s own index.html, as well it’s own css, img, and js subdirectories._
 
* Reading report files
	* http://storm.usc.edu/~username/IML-400/reading-x.html
	_Feel free to style these pages in whichever way you please._

* Final project directory and files:
	* http://storm.usc.edu/~username/IML-400/final/
	_Use a similar structure as your assignments for the subdirectories_

### Policies
#### Fair Use and Citation Guidelines

We assert that all of our course work is covered under the Doctrine of Fair
Use. In order to make this claim, however, all projects will need to include
academically appropriate citations in the form of a Works Cited section,
which covers all sources, in order to receive a passing grade. The Works
Cited is either included in the project or as a separate document, as
appropriate to your project. The style we use is APA 5th edition and you may
refer to these guidelines: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/.


#### Statement on Academic Integrity
USC seeks to maintain an optimal learning environment. General principles
of academic honesty include the concept of respect for the intellectual
property of others, the expectation that individual work will be submitted
unless otherwise allowed by an instructor, and the obligations both to protect
one’s own academic work from misuse by others as well as to avoid using
another’s work as one’s own. All students are expected to understand and
abide by these principles. SCampus, the Student Guidebook, contains the
Student Conduct Code in Section 11.00, while the recommended sanctions
are located in Appendix A: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/SCAMPUS
/gov/. Students will be referred to the Office of Student Judicial Affairs and
Community Standards for further review, should there be any suspicion of
academic dishonesty. The Review process can be found at:

http://www.usc.edu/student-affairs/SJACS/.

#### Statement for Students with Disabilities

Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability is
required to register with Disability Services and Programs (DSP) each
semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be
obtained from DSP. Please be sure the letter is delivered to me (or to TA) as
early in the semester as possible. DSP is located in STU 301 and is open
8:30 a.m.–5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.

#### Emergency Plan

In the event that classes cannot convene at the university, all IML courses
will continue via distance education. Specifically, the IML portal and course
wikis will be deployed to enable faculty-student interaction (asynchronously
and also via virtual office hours), complete syllabi, course readings and
assignments, software tutorials, project assets, parameters and upload
instructions, peer review processes and open source alternatives to
professional-level software used in the IML curriculum. Further details are
available on the course wiki.

The proposal document should be presented as a simple illustrated HTML
webpage covering the following sections:

* Letter of intent
* Theme and Subject
* Scope
* Design
* Research

#### Letter of intent

A simple paragraph explaining your motivation to work on your project of
choice. Describe your own expectations from the finished product and
explain the potential benefit you and others can have from it. In addition to
this, justify your design choices based on the goal to communicate your
subject in an original, optimal manner.

#### Theme and Subject

No personal portfolio websites are allowed. Other than that, there are no
restrictions to the final project's theme or subject as long as it covers the
required scope. However, a reasoned justification of your choice will be required.

#### Scope

The project scope should warrantee the need to use rich media (text, images, video, sound, etc), and an original, non-trivial implementation of presentation and interactivity using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and JQuery.

Viability of scope will require approval upon proposal review.

#### Design

Draw a detailed flow diagram with wireframe pencil thumbnails on paper to outline a tentative sitemap, including a layout proposal for all of the site's sections and interactive components. Explain your design decisions: why are they necessary? how do they benefit the presentation of your content?
