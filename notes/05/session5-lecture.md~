NOTES for new lecture

* Responsive Design:
Designing for different output devices
 * content needs to look and feel great across a wide variety of devices...and network condition (developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode)
   * e.g. Hulu...Hulu.com, Hulu mobile apps (iOS, Android), SmartTV, Xbox, Playstation, SteamOS...
   
- layouts, fonts, images sizes change and scale according to the size of the device
  * maybe cover:
    * svg image fonts..find the tutorial
    * media queries in CSS
      [Media Queries W3C](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp)
      
    * grid layouts in css
    * css commands that adhere to responsive layout
    * flexbox model in CSS
  * Look at some prototyping tools - interactive HTML, wireframe ( InDesign, Illustrator, etc., Axure)
  * Issues:
    * Browser support
    * download speeds

* Example websites of responsive design
  [Media Queries Responsive Designs](http://mediaqueri.es/)

Some resolutions (from mediaqueri.es):
Smartphone 320px
Tablet 768px
Netbook 1024px
Desktop 1600px

## Mobile First
 - primarily design and develop for mobile devices (see the grid css article, delicious tagged)
 - in responsive design the focus is the desktop and conceptually you are scaling information down depending on the device
   * this amounts to hiding certain information
 - in a mobile first approach conceptually you are thinking about content in the lowest common denominator
   * you are starting from a minimalistic space

- Moving onto code as fast as possible is the best practice (metamonks.com) 


## Device Mode in Chrome
[Chrome Developer Tools Mobile Device_ Device Mode](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/device-mode/)

## Tools and Toolkits
* [Yahoo Pure CSS](http://purecss.io/)
* jQuery UI

“User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are some of the most confused and misused terms in our field. A UI without UX is like a painter slapping paint onto canvas without thought; while UX without UI is like the frame of a sculpture with no paper mache on it. A great product experience starts with UX followed by UI. Both are essential for the product’s success.”

_UI_  is the consideration and architecture of how the user interacts with the product. The presentation of the product and how the user can alter its presentation are the chief concerns of UI. UI tactics adhere to the themes of UX design strategy.
